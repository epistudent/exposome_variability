## Abstract
### *BACKGROUND*
Along with time, variation in the exposome is dependent on the location and sex of study participants. One specific factor that may influence exposure co-variations is a shared household environment.

### *OBJECTIVES*
To examine the influence of shared household and partnerâ€™s sex in relation to the variation in 128 endocrine disrupting chemical (EDC) exposures among couples.

### *METHODS* 
In a cohort comprising 501 couples trying for pregnancy, we measured 128 (13 chemical classes) persistent and non persistent EDCs and estimated 1) sex-specific differences; 2) variance explained by shared household; and 3) Spearman's rank correlation coefficients (rs) for females, males, and couples.
